"""Give documents a first-class journal column, and index the metadata filters.

v0.3 extends the retrieval scope with publication year, author, journal,
and DOI filters, all enforced inside every layer's SQL. Journal was the
one dimension with nowhere to live: putting it in ``Document.extra``
would have meant filtering on JSONB in the hot path of five queries. It
becomes a real column, with an index, alongside an index on
``publication_year`` for the year-range condition.

``IF NOT EXISTS`` keeps this a no-op on fresh databases, where 0001's
``create_all`` already created both from the current models.
