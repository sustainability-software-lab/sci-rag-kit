"""Drafting the files a scientist would otherwise hand-author.

Four artifacts stand between the template and a working domain RAG: the
ontology, the corpus manifest, the seed questions, and the prompt wording.
Each drafter here offers the same three lanes, and the shape of this module
is what keeps them one system rather than three:

* **Lane A** gathers context from what is already on disk or in the database,
  calls the configured model, and validates the reply through the same
  pydantic model the loader uses.
* **Lane B** renders the identical prompt to stdout so a scientist with no
  credentials can paste it into any assistant, then reads the reply back from
  a file through the identical validation.
* **Lane C** is writing the file by hand, which nothing here changes.

Model output is untrusted everywhere. A drafter parses, validates, and (for
seed questions) verifies the model's claims against the passages it was
shown, then writes a ``.proposed`` file for review rather than overwriting
work a human vouched for.

The LLM client is imported inside the functions that need it, matching
:mod:`sci_rag.scaffold`: rendering a prompt must not pull in the generation
stack.
