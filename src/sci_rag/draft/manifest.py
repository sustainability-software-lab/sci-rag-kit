"""Drafting a corpus manifest, without letting a model decide your rights.

`sci-rag campaign build` already writes a manifest for DOI-addressable
literature, where rights come from Unpaywall and Crossref rather than from
anybody's judgement. Local PDFs get none of that: `discover_folder()` finds the
files and defaults every other field, so the title, authors, year, and source
bucket are a typing job.

Most of that a model can read off a title page, and a human can correct.
``license_class`` cannot. It is the input to a scoping boundary that decides
what a public endpoint may quote, so this module never lets a model set it.
Every drafted row is written ``unknown``, which is exactly what the fail-closed
default is for, and a license sentence the model found is kept as evidence for
the human making the call.
