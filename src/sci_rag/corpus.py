"""Corpus lifecycle: delete documents, garbage-collect the graph.

A knowledge base that can only grow rots: retracted papers, superseded
reports, and mistaken ingests all need a clean exit. Deletion here is
transactional and reaches every layer:

* the document row goes, and its chunks cascade with it (FK);
* every graph entity scrubs the deleted document and chunk ids from its
  evidence arrays (an entity with remaining evidence survives with a
  smaller footprint; one with none becomes GC-eligible);
* relationships whose evidence lived in the deleted documents go;
* communities whose member entities carried evidence from the deleted
  documents go too, because their stored summaries were written FROM
  that evidence. Community coverage returns on the next
  ``sci-rag graph communities`` run.

``graph_gc`` is the complementary sweep: entities left with no evidence,
relationships with dangling evidence pointers, and communities whose
member lists no longer resolve. It exists so the graph never quietly
serves ghosts, whatever order deletions happened in.
