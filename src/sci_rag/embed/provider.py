"""The embedding provider interface.

Two implementations ship with the kit:

* :class:`~sci_rag.embed.google.GoogleEmbedder` produces real semantic
  vectors with ``gemini-embedding-001`` through either a free AI Studio API
  key or Vertex AI credentials.
* :class:`~sci_rag.embed.local_hash.LocalHashEmbedder` is deterministic and
  fully offline. It exists so you can exercise the entire pipeline (and run
  the test suite) with no credentials; its similarity is lexical, so do not
  judge retrieval quality with it.

Every provider states its ``version``. That string is stamped onto each
chunk at embedding time, which is what makes a later model upgrade findable
("re-embed everything whose version is not current") instead of silent.
