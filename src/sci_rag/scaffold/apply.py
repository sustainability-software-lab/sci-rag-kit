    generated project has already done. Feature regions follow their retained
    files after pruning, so a project never documents a helper or module it no
    longer has. This runs before runner rewriting so kept command examples still
    adopt the selected environment manager.

    The onboarding player's supporting entries in ``mkdocs.yml`` and the
    ``Makefile`` go too, because a dangling asset or deleted renderer would break
    the generated project's documentation build.
