"""The question and answer session.

Three ways in, one answer set out: an interactive session, ``--defaults`` for
a straight-through run, and ``--answers-file`` for reproducible generation in
CI and in the documentation. All three walk the same list in
:mod:`sci_rag.scaffold.questions`, so a question added there is asked by all
three without further wiring.

Prompts are written to the output stream directly rather than through Rich's
prompt helpers. The session transcript is a documented artifact (it is the
example on the homepage), so its exact shape is part of the contract and is
worth more here than styled output.
