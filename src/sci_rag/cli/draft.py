"""`sci-rag draft`: the assisted path to the files you would otherwise type.

Every command here offers the same three lanes, and the flags are the whole
interface to them:

* nothing extra, and the configured model drafts it (Lane A);
* ``--print-prompt``, and the rendered, corpus-grounded prompt goes to stdout
  for pasting into any assistant, then ``--from-file reply.json`` feeds the
  reply back through identical validation (Lane B);
* neither, and you write the file yourself exactly as before (Lane C).

Nothing here overwrites a file a human vouched for. A run proposes
``<file>.proposed`` and prints a summary; ``--apply`` is the separate,
deliberate step.
