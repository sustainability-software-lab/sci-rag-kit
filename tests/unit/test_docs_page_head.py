"""Guards for the block at the top of every documentation page.

Every page opens with the same three things in the same order: a clickable
breadcrumb trail, the page title, and a one-line grey lede. The trail and the
title start at the same height on every page, which is what these tests hold.
The lede sits wherever the title leaves it: a two-line title pushes it down,
and reserving the space to prevent that cost more in dead air under the short
titles than the alignment was worth.

The trail says where the page sits. It names every level of nesting the left
sidebar shows and ends on the page you are reading, so `campaigns.md` reads
`Guides > Discover a corpus` rather than the bare `Guides` the theme stops at.
Section hub pages are the exception: `project.md` is the page the `Project`
crumb already points at, so its only crumb would repeat the title directly
below it. Those pages keep the empty row, which is what holds the height, and
carry no crumbs.

The source-level tests pin the inputs (the theme feature, the template
override, the stylesheet, and the Markdown shape of each page). The build tests
at the end pin the output, by rendering the real site and reading the trail
MkDocs actually emitted.
