"""What an offline project is told when it asks for something a model does.

Offline is a supported mode: the deterministic embedder ingests, retrieves,
and scores without a single model call. The boundary is generation. Crossing
it has to be quick and has to name the thing that is missing, because the two
ways it used to go wrong both cost a reader real time. The deep profile ran
two model-only layers into the credential failure, one stage timeout each,
and then the refusal repeated the embedder's advice: set
``SCI_RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local-hash``, which an offline project already
has and which cannot generate an answer whatever its value.
