"""The domain tutorial's offline branch has to be reachable by succeeding.

`docs/bring-your-own-domain.md` advertises a route without credentials and
tells offline readers to use `--print-prompt` and `--from-file` throughout.
That covers the drafters. It does not cover graph extraction, community
construction, judged answer evaluation, or the cited-answer checkpoint, none
of which has an offline lane, so an offline reader following the page reached
four commands that exit 1 and no stated end state of their own.

A tutorial whose last checkpoint is an expected failure is not a tutorial with
an offline branch. These guards keep every model-only command behind an
explicit credentialed marker, and keep the offline reader's own end state on
the page.
