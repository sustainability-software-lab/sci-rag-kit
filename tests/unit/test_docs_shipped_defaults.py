"""Guards for prose that reports a shipped default or a support claim.

Both guards exist because a defect of this kind is silent, and because it has
now happened twice. Flipping `compression.enabled` in `domain/domain.yaml` is a
one-line edit no test notices, so the pages describing what the demo ships keep
asserting the old state: `docs/architecture.md` reported a paired judged-answer
gate as passed after the v0.3 benchmark re-ran it and it did not hold, and
`docs/evaluation.md` kept the superseded run's table under the sentence "the
demo adopts `compression.enabled: true`". Both are claims about evidence,
contradicted by the evidence. The first was found and corrected by hand; the
second survived that correction, which is the argument for a test.

The support range fails the same way. ADR 0008 sets it, several surfaces repeat
it, and the README kept saying `PostgreSQL 15+` for a floor nothing tested.

So each guard reads the source of truth (the domain profile, `CompressionTuning`,
the ADR) and holds the prose to it, rather than pinning the prose to a literal.
Changing a default is still one line; leaving the pages behind now fails.
