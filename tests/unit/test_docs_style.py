"""Guards for the house style, so the standard in `docs/STYLE.md` holds.

A style guide nobody checks is a document, not a standard. These tests are the
checkable half of `docs/STYLE.md`: every rule here has a sentence there that
explains it to a person, and every rule here is one a machine can decide. The
judgment calls, which are most of the guide, stay a review responsibility.

They exist because this documentation has already drifted twice in the same
direction. Retiring the obvious AI vocabulary left one mannerism behind, the
X-not-Y contrast, running at four times the density of ordinary prose; and one
verb, "specialize", spread to twenty-six places including a generated CLI page
where the word a reader wanted was "configure". Neither is a defect any test
could see, because both were locally correct every single time.

Each test's docstring names the reason it exists, so a contributor who trips
one can tell whether they found a violation or an exception worth adding.
