"""Guards for the documentation site's front-door copy and presentation.

The site description is written in three places that a reader compares directly:
the MkDocs metadata, the landing page heading, and the README lead. They drift
apart easily because nothing else links them. The next two tests widen that to
every surface the product ships a description through, because the site is not
where most people meet it: the PyPI page, `sci-rag --help`, the served OpenAPI
document, and the BibTeX a paper would carry all say what this is, and until
they were tied together only the MkDocs field was guarded. The rest keep the
retired marketing components from being reintroduced by copy-paste, keep the
suggested citation pinned to a version that exists, and keep the product's
display name spelled the way the logo spells it.
