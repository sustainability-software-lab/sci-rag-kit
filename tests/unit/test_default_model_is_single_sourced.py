"""The shipped generation default, named once.

`gemini-2.5-flash` was the default in v0.4.0 and it is refused for any
newly issued AI Studio key: `404 This model is no longer available to new
users`. Every synthetic branch of the onboarding route passed while the one
branch a real reader takes was broken, because nothing offline can tell a
model id that works from one that does not.

Offline tests cannot fix that. What they can do is make the default
impossible to update by halves. It was written out longhand in eight places
under `src/`, so a fix applied to `config.py` alone would leave the wizard,
the scaffolder, and the preflight still offering a dead model, and the
resulting bug would look exactly like the one being fixed.

The live half of this guard is `tests/cloud/test_default_model_live.py`,
which calls the model and is skipped without credentials.
