"""The backup runbook, executed rather than read.

F-006 in the 2026-08-29 documentation route audit: the local backup procedure
ran `pg_dump "$SCI_RAG_DATABASE_URL_SYNC"`, but no setting, environment
example, helper, or earlier instruction ever defines that name. In a normal
shell it expanded to an empty first argument; under `bash -u` it aborted
before `pg_dump` could run.

A backup procedure is only correct if it runs, so these tests run it. The
documented commands are extracted from the page, a stub `pg_dump` on `PATH`
records what it was actually handed, and the assertions are about that
recording. Nothing here opens a socket or contacts a database.
