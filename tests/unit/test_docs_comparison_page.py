"""Guards for the one page whose whole purpose is being honest about limits.

`choosing-sci-rag-kit.md` is the page a reader trusts to say what the kit does
not do. That makes it the page where a stale claim costs the most, and it is
structurally the most likely to go stale: every sentence is about a boundary,
and shipping a feature moves a boundary without touching this file. It said
other model providers were "a contribution away" for the whole time after ADR
0006 shipped three adapters.

These guards pin the two claims that go stale on their own. A shipped provider
adapter has to be named here, so growing the supported set forces a re-read.
Assertions about other projects have to carry a date, so a reader can judge how
old they are and a maintainer knows when they were last checked. And a count of
files is banned outright: it was wrong by a factor of six, it would need editing
most weeks to stay right, and it was never the claim worth making.
