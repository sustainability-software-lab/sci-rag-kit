"""The release page's notes come from the changelog, so the parse has to hold.

This runs unattended, once, after the package is already on PyPI and the
version number is spent. There is no second attempt at that point, so the
failure modes below are the interesting part: an absent section, an empty one,
and the `[Unreleased]` heading, which shares the shape of a version heading and
must never be published as if it were a release.
