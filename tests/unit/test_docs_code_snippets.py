"""Guards for how the documentation presents code snippets.

Readers copy these blocks into their own project, so a snippet that quotes a
project file has to say which file it came from. The header bar is the only
place that can say it, and a header naming a path that does not exist is worse
than no header at all. These tests keep both halves honest: every header that
is not one of the two environment labels resolves to a real repository path,
and every snippet written in a language this repository only ever uses to quote
a project file carries such a header.

# route is two commands: `--print-prompt` renders a corpus-grounded prompt, and

# `--folder` decide which passages those are, so the page says to pass the same
# values to both. Its own example passed `--count 10` only to the first, and
# worked anyway because ten is also the default. The stated invariant and the
