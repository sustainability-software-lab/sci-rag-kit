"""Guards for the FAQ, which is a synthesis and therefore goes stale silently.

Every other page owns its subject. The FAQ borrows one: it restates, briefly,
what the decision records already argue at length, so the decision records can
stay the place a reversal condition lives. That shape has one failure mode. Add
a ninth ADR and nothing breaks, nothing warns, and the page that a reader treats
as the index of "why is it built this way" quietly stops being one. ADR 0008
landed between this page being planned and being written, which is the same
failure caught early.

So the first guard is the one that matters: every decision record is reachable
from a question. The rest keep the page's shape (topic groups, questions phrased
as questions) and keep it from becoming an orphan that only the nav links to.
