# Versioning

sci-rag-kit follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). This
page spells out the 0.x rules: "semver" alone does not promise anything
before 1.0, and users deserve clarity on what holds.

## While we are 0.x

- **Minor releases (0.2 -> 0.3) may break APIs**, and the CHANGELOG
  says so explicitly under a "Breaking" heading with a migration note.
  We break deliberately and loudly, never silently.
- **Patch releases (0.2.0 -> 0.2.1) do not break anything**: fixes,
  docs, and additive features only.
- **The database schema is versioned by Alembic migrations**
  (`migrations/versions/`), and every release's migrations run forward
  from any prior release's schema. Skipping releases is fine;
  downgrades are best-effort.
- **Eval report JSON is additive**: new keys may appear in
  `report.json`/`calibration.json`; existing keys do not change meaning
  or type within 0.x. External tooling (the UW SSEC evaluation platform
  seam) can rely on that.
- **Domain profiles are forward-compatible.** A `domain/` directory
  written for an older 0.x keeps working. New capabilities arrive as
  optional keys with safe defaults; the reranker block is the model, where
  absent means off.

## What is public API

The compatibility promise covers:

1. The `sci_rag` Python package's documented top-level exports
   (`docs/api.md`)
2. The CLI command surface (`sci-rag ...`)
3. The REST contract under `/v1` and the MCP tool names/schemas
4. The `domain/` directory format
5. Eval report JSON keys

Internal module paths (anything not in `docs/api.md`) may move in any
minor release.

## Deprecation

Within 0.x: deprecated surface keeps working for one minor release with
a visible warning, then goes. The CHANGELOG lists every deprecation, the
release it starts in, and the release it lands in.

## Criteria for 1.0

1.0 is a promise, so it waits for evidence the promise can be kept:

- At least two production deployments outside the maintainers' own
  (ADOPTERS.md is the register; BioCirV is the flagship candidate)
- One full minor-release cycle with no breaking change needed to the
  five public surfaces above
- The benchmark page reproducible by an outside party from a clean
  clone (`make benchmark`)
- Judge calibration against domain-expert labels (not the shipped
  non-expert seed set) published for at least one real corpus
- Security review of the serving layer since the last surface change

After 1.0: breaking changes only in major releases, with migration
guides.

## Release mechanics

Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` from `main` with CI green, a CHANGELOG
entry, and (once the maintainer enables it; see the launch-gated list in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)) an archival DOI per release.

Pushing the tag runs [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](https://github.com/sustainability-software-lab/sci-rag-kit/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml),
which verifies, publishes to TestPyPI, then publishes to PyPI:

1. `verify` runs four checks. It confirms the `ci` workflow already
   passed for the tagged commit, confirms the tag matches
   `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`, runs `uv build`, and installs
   the built wheel into a throwaway environment to check the main `sci-rag`
   CLI and the `sci-rag-new` compatibility entry point are both on the path.
2. `testpypi` publishes to TestPyPI. It runs first on every release
   because PyPI does not allow re-uploading a version, even a broken one,
   so a packaging mistake found on PyPI costs a version number.
3. `pypi` publishes to PyPI.

The tag is the source of truth for the version, and the verify job enforces
that. The project generator fetches the template at the tag matching its own
installed version, so a release whose tag and packaged version disagree would
generate projects from the wrong commit.

### One-time setup, by a maintainer

The workflow uses [Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/)
(OIDC), so the repository stores no API token to leak or rotate. You
establish that trust once per index, by hand. CI cannot do it for you:

1. Reserve `sci-rag-kit` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and on
   [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/). They are separate accounts and
   separate namespaces.
2. On each index, add a pending publisher for the project:
   - Owner: `sustainability-software-lab`
   - Repository: `sci-rag-kit`
   - Workflow: `release.yml`
   - Environment: `pypi` on PyPI, `testpypi` on TestPyPI
3. Create the matching GitHub environments (`pypi`, `testpypi`) in the
   repository settings. Put a required reviewer on `pypi` for the first
   release; that turns the final publish into a decision you make rather
   than one a tag push makes for you.
4. Verify end to end before approving the PyPI publish, from a clean
   directory. Install the TestPyPI **artifact by URL** and let dependencies
   resolve from real PyPI:

   ```bash
   WHEEL=$(curl -sS https://test.pypi.org/pypi/sci-rag-kit/<version>/json \
     | python -c "import json,sys; print(next(u['url'] for u in json.load(sys.stdin)['urls'] if u['packagetype']=='bdist_wheel'))")
   uv venv probe && VIRTUAL_ENV=probe uv pip install "$WHEEL"
   probe/bin/sci-rag new --defaults
   probe/bin/sci-rag-new --help
   ```

   Do not point the installer at both indexes at once. TestPyPI is full of
   placeholder and name-squatted packages, and any resolver told to consider
   both may prefer a fake `fastapi 1.0` from TestPyPI over the real
   one. Installing the single artifact by URL sidesteps that entirely: it
   tests the thing you built, with the dependencies your users will get.

   What to check before approving: both entry points run,
   `sci_rag.__version__` matches the tag, and `sci-rag new --defaults` produces
   a project. The generation command is the only check that exercises the
   GitHub tag fetch, which is the part a PyPI upload cannot tell you about. The
   separate help command confirms the legacy executable remains available as a
   compatibility alias.

Skip step 2 on an index and that index's job fails with a
missing-publisher error. It publishes nothing and costs nothing; configure
it and re-run the workflow.
