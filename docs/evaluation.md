# Evaluate your pipeline

Leave with a reproducible before-and-after on your own corpus. The harness uses mechanical retrieval metrics against expert ground truth, compares performance layer by layer, and grades in two passes: one checking whether the cited sources support the claims, the other checking whether those claims are right.

<div class="srag-meta-strip">
  <div><strong>You'll build</strong>A reproducible before-and-after on your own corpus</div>
  <div><strong>You'll need</strong>An ingested corpus and seed questions</div>
  <div><strong>Time</strong>About 20 minutes for the first run</div>
  <div><strong>Credentials</strong>Required for judged answers</div>
  <div><strong>Tested with</strong>v0.4</div>
</div>

## Before you start

| Requirement | Why | Check |
|---|---|---|
| An ingested corpus | Every metric is computed against real chunks | `uv run sci-rag stats` |
| `domain/eval_seed_questions.jsonl`, reviewed | This file is the ground truth. Drafted rows still tagged `drafted` make every number provisional | `uv run sci-rag doctor` |
| A model credential | Retrieval metrics run offline; judged answers do not | `grep SCI_RAG_GOOGLE .env` |
| A corpus snapshot, for anything you will cite | A number without a corpus identity is not reproducible | `uv run sci-rag corpus snapshot` |

## The two commands

```bash
sci-rag eval retrieval --ablation   # did the right evidence come back, per layer?
sci-rag eval answers                # are the generated answers grounded, cited, correct?
```

Both read `domain/eval_seed_questions.jsonl`, compute the metrics, print a summary table, and write a JSON and Markdown report to `eval_results/`. Every report carries a corpus fingerprint (documents, chunks, graph size, embedding versions, latest ingestion time) and the git commit, which means the numbers are repeatable. Keep the reports so you can cite the fingerprint when you publish.

Compact example tables from a demo run live at
[examples/demo-eval/retrieval-ablation.md](examples/demo-eval/retrieval-ablation.md)
and [examples/demo-eval/answers.md](examples/demo-eval/answers.md).
The dated numbers and confidence intervals to cite are on the
[benchmarks](benchmarks.md) page.

## Seed questions: your ground truth

One JSON object per line:

```jsonl title="domain/eval_seed_questions.jsonl"
{"id": "biogas-yield-pretreated",
 "question": "What biogas yield does alkali-pretreated rice straw achieve per dry ton?",
 "reference_answer": "About 320 cubic meters per dry ton at roughly 54 percent methane.",
 "reference_titles": ["Anaerobic Digestion of Crop Residues: A Working Primer"],
 "evidence_phrases": ["alkali pretreated", "320"],
 "tags": ["conversion"]}
```

* **question**: exactly as a user would ask it, not exam-speak.
* **reference_answer**: what a correct answer must say. An expert should
  be willing to sign it.
* **reference_titles**: the documents that contain the answer.
* **evidence_phrases**: distinctive strings from the passages that
  answer it. Numbers with units are ideal; short generic strings (under
  three characters) are ignored on purpose.
* **tags**: your own labels, plus two special values. `unanswerable`
  marks an honesty probe (see below), and `drafted` marks a question a
  model wrote that no expert has checked yet (see below).

Three recommendations for writing seed questions: ten excellent questions outclass a hundred vague ones. Include one or two multi-hop questions where evidence spans documents, because that tests whether the kit can chain reasoning across chunks. Grow the set from real user questions, starting with the ones your system got wrong.

For help drafting seed questions from scratch,
[`sci-rag draft questions`](bring-your-own-domain.md#step-5-write-seed-questions-then-measure) writes a first pass
grounded in your own documents and verifies every quoted phrase against the
passage it claims to come from.

If questions already exist,
[`sci-rag draft seed-from-answers questions.txt`](bring-your-own-domain.md#step-5-write-seed-questions-then-measure) fills
in the rest. It answers each of your questions and proposes the reference
answer and evidence phrases from what that answer cited, keeping only phrases
that appear verbatim in both the answer and its source. Rows arrive tagged
`drafted` like any other draft, and the reference answers are the kit's own
words, so they are hypotheses until you have checked them.

## Drafted ground truth is provisional, and the report says so

A question tagged `drafted` came from a model. That tag is provenance, and
it travels into the reports: while any question carries it, both
`sci-rag eval retrieval` and `sci-rag eval answers` print a warning saying
how many of the questions behind the numbers are unreviewed, and the JSON
carries the same receipt.

The JSON block sits beside the corpus fingerprint:

```json
"ground_truth": {"drafted": 7, "reviewed": 3}
```

Read the question, check its evidence against the document it cites, then delete the `drafted` tag. That deletion is the expert sign-off, and it is the only thing that moves the counts. The kit does not remove the tag automatically.

## Retrieval metrics, and how to read the ablation table

A retrieved item counts as **relevant** to a question if it comes from a reference document or contains an evidence phrase (case and whitespace normalized). From that definition: hit@5 (was relevant in the top 5), hit@10, and MRR (mean reciprocal rank of the first relevant item).

This metric is deliberately mechanical. Its job is catching regression and showing what each layer contributes, not evaluating correctness; the judged-answer eval is where quality judgment lives. Retrieval metrics never grade answer text by substring matching because that would conflate paraphrase with grounding. The judge exists to detect when the kit paraphrases beautifully but answers incorrectly.

`--ablation` re-runs the questions under the registered configurations:
`full_deep`, `interactive`, `vector_only`, `keyword_only`, `no_graph`,
`confidence_weighted`, `with_citations`, `no_hyde`, `no_community`, the paired reranker rows,
`auto_routed`, and `no_retracted`. Entity resolution changes persisted corpus state, not
retrieval kwargs, so it is intentionally not a row in this same-state table.
Capture it as two named snapshots instead:

```bash
sci-rag eval retrieval --snapshot before-resolution
sci-rag graph resolve-entities --apply
sci-rag eval retrieval --condition resolved_entities --snapshot after-resolution
sci-rag eval diff BEFORE.json AFTER.json
```

The post-resolution command requires a durable merge audit row, preventing an
unchanged corpus from being mislabeled. Read every layer-ablation row against
`full_deep`:

* A layer earns its fusion weight when **removing** it hurts. If `no_graph`
  equals `full_deep` on your corpus, your graph is not contributing yet;
  fix the ontology or the corpus before touching weights.
* `vector_only` versus `keyword_only` tells you how your users' phrasing
  relates to your documents' phrasing. On the demo corpus, keyword-only
  scores 0.33 where vector scores 1.00; that gap is the reason hybrid
  retrieval exists.
* Small corpora saturate: with five demo documents, most configs hit
  1.00 and only the differences matter. Expect real spread as the corpus
  grows.

<div class="srag-checkpoint" markdown>
**Checkpoint: measure each layer's contribution**

Point at one row of the ablation table and say what removing that layer cost on the corpus. If every row equals `full_deep`, the ablation signals a corpus that is too small or an ontology that is not matching; no weight adjustment will be measurable.
</div>

## Grade answers in two passes

Grading a generated answer happens in two independent passes that cannot influence each other.

**Pass 1: grounding (blind).** The judge sees the question, the answer, and exactly the sources the assistant retrieved. It scores three dimensions (each 0 to 2): groundedness (do the sources support the claims?), citation accuracy (do the bracketed numbers point at sources that actually back up the adjacent claim?), and completeness (did the answer use the relevant material you gave it?). The judge never sees the reference answer. A judge that did see it would reward answers that match the reference even when the sources contradict it, converting grounding into paraphrase detection.

**Pass 2: correctness (reference-based).** A second call compares the answer against the expert reference, without the sources. It scores factual agreement from 0 to 2. The reference is a floor, not a ceiling: extra correct detail is never penalized.

Both passes run at temperature 0. Malformed judge responses fail rather than get coerced into a score. The judge prompts live in `domain/prompts/judge_grounding.md` and `judge_correctness.md`. If you edit them, keep the blindness rules intact and spot-check a few judged answers by hand afterward. That is why the rationale strings are kept in `report.json`.

## Deciding whether to adopt snippet compression

Contextual snippet compression is an answer-generation decision, not a retrieval ablation. Test it against your corpus by running the same question set twice on the same corpus snapshot, with the same models, and comparing the judged results:

```bash
uv run sci-rag eval answers --snapshot uncompressed
uv run sci-rag eval answers --compressed --snapshot compressed
uv run sci-rag eval diff eval_results/<uncompressed>/report.json \
  eval_results/<compressed>/report.json
```

Adopt compression only when every judged dimension stays within the confidence interval and median prompt tokens drop noticeably. Otherwise, keep `compression.enabled: false` and record why. Token savings alone do not show answer quality stayed the same; the grounded and correctness scores must stay strong too.

The demo's own comparison, run at three floors on the v0.3 benchmark with
10 seed questions and one corpus snapshot:

| relevance_floor | groundedness | citation accuracy | completeness | correctness | median prompt tokens |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| uncompressed | 2.00 | 2.00 | 2.00 | 1.60 | 1359 |
| **0.0** | **2.00** | **2.00** | 1.90 | 1.70 | **990** |
| 0.15 | 1.80 | 1.80 | 1.60 | 1.70 | 348 |
| 0.3 | 1.80 | 1.80 | 1.80 | 1.50 | 356 |

The demo enables compression at floor 0.0, where every source is summarized and
none dropped. [See the benchmarks for the full gate](benchmarks.md#contextual-compression-the-paired-gate).

## Calibrating the judge

The judged-answers table is only as citable as the judge behind it. The kit ships calibration as a repeatable workflow you can run yourself:

1. Run an answers eval (`sci-rag eval answers`) and open `report.json` from `eval_results/`.
2. Have a human read each generated answer (and its sources) **without** looking at the judge's scores. Record their own 0-2 scores per dimension, one JSON object per line:

   ```
   {"question_id": "rice-straw-ash", "groundedness": 2,
    "citation_accuracy": 2, "completeness": 1, "correctness": 2}
   ```

   Comment lines starting with `#` are allowed. Omit dimensions you did not score.
3. Compare your labels to the judge's:

   ```bash
   uv run sci-rag eval calibrate --labels labels.jsonl --report eval_results/<run>/report.json
   ```

   You get Cohen's kappa per dimension, exact-agreement counts, and the full 3x3 matrices. The output appends to `report.md` and saves as `calibration.json` so the kappa travels with the numbers.

Report kappa exactly as the tool computes it. The Landis-Koch adjective ("moderate", "substantial") is a reading aid, not a target. A low kappa means the judge and humans disagree on that dimension; the matrix shows how. Expect unstable kappa below about 30 labeled answers. More labels from a domain expert make the number trustworthy.

The repo ships `domain/eval_calibration_labels.jsonl`: a seed label set
for the demo corpus, labeled by the kit's authors. It is marked
non-expert, and it earns that label: it demonstrates the workflow and pins
the format, nothing more. Domain-expert labels supersede it for any real
claim about judge reliability, and the BioCirV collaboration supplies
those for the flagship deployment.

## Sharing a run with someone who has no terminal

A domain expert asked to sanity-check ten judged answers should not have to clone the repository. `sci-rag eval html` renders a run as one file you can email:

```bash
uv run sci-rag eval html eval_results/<run>
```

It writes `report.html` next to the report, or wherever `--output` points. The page is self-contained: inline styles, no external fonts or scripts, nothing fetched when it opens. That matters because pages that phone home render differently for each reader, and can fail behind a corporate firewall.

It leads with the provenance receipt so a reader who cannot run commands can see which model produced what they are reading. The small-sample and drafted-ground-truth warnings sit next to the metrics in the same places `report.md` puts them. `calibration.json` is included automatically when it sits beside the report.

In an ablation table, cells whose confidence intervals overlap the baseline are shaded; cells that clear the interval are bold. Overlapping intervals are how these tables get misread most often, and on a tiny corpus most cells will be shaded. That is the honest reading, not a rendering bug.

## Honesty probes

Include at least one question your corpus cannot answer, tagged `unanswerable`. Retrieval metrics skip it; the answer eval runs it. A healthy system responds "the corpus does not cover this" and the grounding judge scores that honesty a 2. If your probe comes back with a confident invented answer, stop tuning retrieval and fix your answer prompt first. A system that hallucinates confidently is worse than one that retrieves wrong evidence.

## CI keeps the demo honest

`tests/integration/test_eval_smoke.py` runs the retrieval eval on the shipped demo corpus with the offline embedder on every CI run. It uses conservative thresholds (hit@10 at least 0.65) to catch a broken chunker, layer, or seed file before it ships. Copy that pattern for your own corpus: freeze a small fixture, pin thresholds at your current numbers, and fail loudly if anything regresses.

## The improvement loop

1. Establish the baseline: both eval commands, reports saved.
2. Change one thing (chunk size, a prompt, the ontology, a fusion
   weight).
3. Re-run, then let the diff tool do the comparison:

   ```bash
   uv run sci-rag eval diff eval_results/<baseline-run> eval_results/<new-run>
   ```

   It reports which questions moved (improved, regressed, appeared,
   disappeared) and whether each metric delta clears paired-bootstrap
   significance, so a lucky rank flip on one question cannot pass as an
   improvement.
4. Keep the change only if the numbers (and your reading of the judged
   answers) agree it helped.

When two people disagree about whether a change helped, the reports settle it.

<div class="srag-checkpoint" markdown>
**Checkpoint: the numbers are citable**

The newest report names a corpus snapshot, a git commit, the answering and grading models, and the enabled layers, and no question carries the `drafted` tag. A number missing any of these cannot be cited in a methods section.
