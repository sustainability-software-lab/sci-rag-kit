# Extend the kit

Choose one of five extension points: parser, corpus collector, reranker, model provider, or
authentication backend. Protect its existing behavior with tests, and measure any change to
retrieval. Sci RAG Kit does not use a plug-in registry.

<div class="srag-meta-strip">
  <div><strong>You'll build</strong>A new parser, collector, reranker, provider, or auth backend</div>
  <div><strong>You'll need</strong>A working checkout and its test suite</div>
  <div><strong>Time</strong>An hour to a day, depending on the extension</div>
  <div><strong>Tested with</strong>v0.4</div>
</div>

## Before you start

| Requirement | Why | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `make check` green on an unmodified checkout | Separates baseline failures from your change | `make check` |
| A read of [Architecture](architecture.md) | Places each extension point in the ownership map | |
| An evaluation baseline, for anything touching ranking | Makes the retrieval change measurable | `uv run sci-rag eval retrieval --ablation` |

## Choose an extension point

| Need | Contract | Primary file | Evidence to add |
|---|---|---|---|
| New document type | Produce the shared parsed block model | `src/sci_rag/ingest/parsers.py` | Parser and chunking tests with a fixture |
| New source system | Produce `CorpusEntry` values | `src/sci_rag/ingest/manifest.py` | Metadata, rights, pagination, and resume tests |
| New post-fusion ranking | Implement `Reranker` | `src/sci_rag/retrieve/rerank.py` | Failure fallback test and before/after ablation |
| New embedding or generation model | Implement `EmbeddingProvider` or `LLMClient` | `src/sci_rag/embed/`, `src/sci_rag/llm/` | Offline contract tests plus version and dimension checks |
| New identity system | Implement `AuthBackend` and wire the app factory | `src/sci_rag/server/auth.py` | Auth, scope, rate, REST, and MCP coverage |

## 1. Add a document parser

`parse_file()` dispatches by suffix and returns one `ParsedDocument`. Structured parsers produce ordered `Block` values: `heading`, `text`, or `table`. The chunker owns normalization, token sizing, overlap, and section breadcrumbs.

Uphold these properties:

- Report which route was used when a fallback changes fidelity.
- Keep tables as one block when possible.
- Do not repeat the document title in every section path.
- Fail with the supported list when the suffix is unknown, and reject blank text.
- Add a test with a fixture demonstrating block order and metadata.

Add the suffix to `SUPPORTED_SUFFIXES`, add a branch in `parse_file()`, and let the ingester handle deduplication, embedding, and transactions.

## 2. Add a corpus collector

A collector emits `CorpusEntry` records containing a local path plus source metadata:

```python title="src/sci_rag/ingest/manifest.py"
path: Path
title: str | None
authors: list[str]
year: int | None
doi: str | None
journal: str | None
url: str | None
license_class: str
source: str
```

Resolve remote bytes to stable local paths before ingestion. Normalize identifiers and retain provider source references. Rate-limit external APIs and make resume behavior explicit. If you cannot establish redistribution rights, leave `license_class` as `unknown`.

## 3. Add a reranker

`Reranker` is a structural protocol with one async operation:

```python title="src/sci_rag/retrieve/rerank.py"
class Reranker(Protocol):
    name: str

    async def rerank(
        self, query: str, items: list[RetrievedItem], *, top_k: int
    ) -> list[RetrievedItem]: ...
```

The orchestrator passes a wider fused pool and expects a reordered, truncated list. If the reranker raises an exception, leave a visible trace and fall back to the fused order. Add adapter selection to the domain tuning model only when projects need to configure it.

Do not enable a new reranker by default. Run `sci-rag eval retrieval --ablation` with and without it on your corpus, including latency and confidence intervals.

## 4. Add a model provider

An embedding provider exposes `version`, `dim`, and one batch method:

```python title="src/sci_rag/embed/provider.py"
class EmbeddingProvider(ABC):
    version: str
    dim: int

    async def embed(
        self, texts: list[str], *, task: EmbeddingTask
    ) -> list[list[float]]: ...
```

Stamp a provider-specific version whenever stored vectors become incompatible, and assert every returned dimension. Distinguish document and query tasks when the model supports asymmetric embeddings. Normalize vectors if the provider's reduced dimensions require it.

An LLM client implements full generation and streaming. JSON consumers use the shared `generate_json()` helper to request deterministic JSON mode and remove a surrounding code fence.

Provider additions need a deliberate selection path in `get_embedder()` or `get_llm()`. This factory keeps supported providers in one place.

### Generation providers that ship with the kit

Three adapters live in `src/sci_rag/llm/`, selected by a `provider:model` spec. A bare model id uses `SCI_RAG_LLM_PROVIDER`; a prefixed one overrides it.

| Provider | Reaches | Credentials | Extra |
|---|---|---|---|
| `google` | Gemini | `SCI_RAG_GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `SCI_RAG_GCP_PROJECT` | built in |
| `anthropic` | Claude, on Vertex or the direct API | `SCI_RAG_GCP_PROJECT` (ADC) or `SCI_RAG_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropic` |
| `openai-compatible` | Vertex partner models (Grok, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek), OpenAI, self-hosted vLLM/Ollama | `SCI_RAG_GCP_PROJECT` (ADC) or `SCI_RAG_OPENAI_API_KEY` (+ optional `SCI_RAG_OPENAI_BASE_URL`) | `openai` |

On Google Cloud, the third row is the path to non-Google partner models. Vertex serves them behind an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so the same adapter covers each supported model. Model ids keep their publisher prefix, such as `xai/grok-4.1-fast-reasoning`; the adapter rejects a bare id.

!!! warning "Check partner-model regions"

    `SCI_RAG_GCP_LOCATION` defaults to `us-central1`, which serves Gemini. Claude and Grok require `global`, and Grok is available only there. Set `SCI_RAG_GCP_LOCATION=global` when generating with a partner model. Google embeddings work from `global` too, though slower than from a region.

    An unsupported location returns a `400`; a missing or unavailable model returns a `404`. `sci-rag doctor --probe` catches these before a pipeline run and recommends `SCI_RAG_GCP_LOCATION=global` for the location error. A `404` can also mean the model id is wrong or the project has not enabled that offering.

    Which models a project can reach depends on its Model Garden settings. Check the example ids above with `doctor` before using them.

!!! note "Partner model ids are dated examples"

    Partner models come and go on a schedule this project does not control. Every id here and in `.env.example` last answered both ordinary generation and strict JSON calls on **2026-08-30**, from `global`. Google publishes each model's lifecycle on [Vertex AI partner-models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models).

    Verify your models before using them:

    ```console title="Terminal"
    $ make providers-check
    ```

    It calls each model at its documented location and fails when one no longer works. It needs `SCI_RAG_GCP_PROJECT` and application-default credentials. A model absent from your Model Garden also fails it.

### What a new adapter has to normalize

`LLMClient` presents one signature to every call site. An adapter absorbs the differences between providers:

| `generate()` argument | google | anthropic | openai-compatible |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system` | `system_instruction` | `system=` | leading `system` message |
| `temperature` | forwarded | **dropped** | forwarded |
| `max_tokens` | `max_output_tokens` | `max_tokens` (required) | `max_tokens` |
| `json_mode` | `response_mime_type` + `thinking_budget=0` | `output_config={"effort": "low"}` | `response_format` |

Two mappings are tricky:

- **Current Claude models removed the sampling parameters.** Forwarding `temperature` returns a 400, so the Anthropic adapter drops it. Low temperature intent maps to `effort` instead.
- **Keep thinking enabled when lowering effort.** Disabling thinking on current Claude models can leak reasoning tags into visible text and corrupt the parsed JSON.
- **Not every Claude model accepts the effort knob.** `claude-sonnet-5` takes it; `claude-haiku-4-5` rejects it. The adapter probes once per client and remembers the result.

Where a provider may reject a knob, adapters retry once without it. Retry policy is shared: `retry_async()` in `llm/client.py` manages backoff. SDK clients are constructed with `max_retries=0` to prevent compounding retries.

### Embeddings are Google-only on purpose

`SCI_RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` accepts `google` or `local-hash`. There is no third option by design. Anthropic ships no embedding API. On Vertex, the only managed text embeddings are Google's. Every alternative means deploying and paying for your own Model Garden endpoint.

Changing the embedder requires a migration, full re-embedding, and index rebuild. The migration bakes `SCI_RAG_EMBEDDING_DIM` into the pgvector column (see [ADR 0002](adr/0002-embeddings-1536-hnsw.md)), and each chunk stores the `version` that produced it.

`sci-rag embed reindex` reports which rows a version change affects and writes nothing by default. It fails if the configured dimension does not match the live column. The separate `--apply` step performs the re-embedding. Point `SCI_RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL` at another Google embedding model; treat any broader change as a data migration.

## 5. Add an authentication backend

`AuthBackend` has two synchronous operations: authenticate a bearer token into an `AuthContext`, and enforce its rate limit. The shipped factory selects open local mode or static JSON keys from `SCI_RAG_API_KEYS`.

To add OAuth or institutional identity:

1. Map external identity and claims to the existing scope vocabulary.
2. Implement `authenticate()` and `check_rate()`.
3. Wire the backend into the application factory to guard REST and `/mcp`.
4. Keep `application/problem+json` error codes stable.
5. Test REST and MCP access together.

`create_app()` builds the shipped backend from settings. Keep factory changes explicit, and never import arbitrary authentication code from configuration.

## Invariants for every extension point

- Apply rights scope and all other document conditions before the candidate limit.
- Record optional-component failures in the trace even when the request continues.
- Validate stored model output, dropping or rejecting unknown ontology values and malformed JSON.
- Add domain logic to `RagService` before exposing it through REST or MCP.
- Run tests offline by default and mark credentialed coverage with the `cloud` tag.
- Include ablation results with every retrieval change.

**Checkpoint: the extension passes**

Completion requires a green `make check`, an offline test that exercises the new code, and two ablation tables from the same corpus fingerprint when ranking changed.
