# Benchmarks

Measured results on the shipped demo corpus, regenerated with one command.
This page proves the evaluation harness end to end and publishes honest
numbers for this template on its own demo corpus. It makes no
state-of-the-art claim and compares against no other system; see
[Choosing Sci RAG Kit](choosing-sci-rag-kit.md) for that comparison, on
axes other than benchmark scores.

## What was measured

- Corpus: 5 documents, 34 chunks, 67 entities, 78 relationships, 8 communities (the synthetic agricultural-residue demo corpus shipped in `data/demo/`)
- Corpus snapshot: `benchmark-20260902-051515` (see `data/snapshots/`; the digest pins the exact document set)
- Embedding: `gemini-embedding-001@1536`; models: answer `google:gemini-3.6-flash`, extraction `google:gemini-3.6-flash`, judge `google:gemini-3.6-flash`
- Code: commit `44ecac4`; domain and prompts: `11194722ed59`
- Graph: strict replay from `data/demo/graph-replay/a24c3fb88f163941048866b86fc494a3470337b0c24257f1d9235c8b00f19d15.json` (`a24c3fb88f163941048866b86fc494a3470337b0c24257f1d9235c8b00f19d15`); 4 recorded calls replayed, 0 live extraction calls; canonical graph `3ec1cba1f5484bef25101812c3240cecb5b1be55652c3caebea2e2c1d5485b14`

The reviewed graph replay makes entity and relationship counts exact. Judged answers and other model-backed measurements remain stochastic. Repeating the command below reproduces those measurements within a declared tolerance of 0.1 absolute on a metric and 10% on other counts, and `--check` fails visibly when one moves further. A number that moves beyond it is a finding, not a refresh: publishing it needs a reviewed source report and an explanation of which recorded input changed.

## Retrieval ablations

Cells are mean [95% bootstrap CI], resampled per question. The
demo corpus has single-digit questions, so intervals are wide by
construction: treat differences whose intervals overlap heavily as
noise, and read the table for the qualitative story (which layers
earn their keep) rather than decimal places. On a small sample
like this, that qualitative story is the only defensible claim.

`resolved_entities` is absent, and that is a result rather than an
omission. It is a separate condition (`sci-rag eval retrieval
--condition resolved_entities`) measured on a post-resolution
snapshot, and it requires at least one persisted resolution audit
row. On this corpus `sci-rag graph resolve-entities` finds no
automatic pairs and plans no merges: 67 extracted entities with
nothing duplicated enough to merge. The command refuses to run the
condition rather than report a number that would just be
`full_deep` under another name. A corpus with real alias variation
is what would exercise it.

How to read it:

- `full_deep` vs the `*_only` rows shows what fusion buys over any
  single layer.
- `no_graph` / `no_hyde` / `no_community` vs `full_deep` shows each
  layer's marginal contribution on this corpus.
- `with_rerank` vs `no_rerank` is the paired evidence the reranker
  must show before `retrieval.reranker.enabled: true` is justified.
- `auto_routed` vs `full_deep` and `interactive` is the evidence for
  (or against) making adaptive routing a default. Until it clearly
  matches `full_deep` at lower cost, `auto` stays opt-in.

## Judged answers (blind two-pass judge)

| Dimension | Mean [95% CI] |
|-----------|--------------:|
| groundedness | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| citation_accuracy | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| completeness | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| correctness | 1.80 [1.40, 2.00] |
| graded / total | 10 / 10 |

The grounding judge never sees the reference answer; correctness
is graded in a separate reference-only pass (docs/evaluation.md).

## Contextual compression: the paired gate

Compression defaults on for the shipped demo at `relevance_floor: 0.0`.

Two judged-answer runs over the same questions and the same corpus,
one with `--compressed` and one without. The gate requires judged
quality to HOLD while measured prompt tokens fall. A
token saving on its own is not evidence; it is half of a trade.

Measured at `relevance_floor: 0.0`, which is the load-bearing
setting, not a detail. The floor decides whether a source is dropped
or summarized, and dropping evidence is what an answer cannot recover
from. Raising it trades groundedness for tokens; that is a different
trade from summarizing, and it needs its own paired run.

| Dimension | Uncompressed | Compressed |
|-----------|-------------:|-----------:|
| groundedness | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| citation_accuracy | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| completeness | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| correctness | 1.80 [1.40, 2.00] | 2.00 [2.00, 2.00] |
| median prompt tokens | 1315 | 887 (33% lower) |

Sources dropped by the relevance floor: 0. Compression failures: 0. Questions: 10.

On this run the gate holds: no judged dimension fell while prompt tokens dropped. That justifies the default on THIS corpus only; re-run the gate before carrying it to another.

## Judge calibration (human labels vs judge)

Cohen's kappa between independent human labels
(`domain/eval_calibration_labels.jsonl`, a NON-EXPERT seed set)
and the judge's scores on the same answers:

| Dimension | kappa | exact agreement | n |
|-----------|------:|----------------:|--:|
| groundedness | 1.00 | 1.00 | 10 |
| citation_accuracy | 1.00 | 1.00 | 10 |
| completeness | 1.00 | 1.00 | 10 |
| correctness | 0.00 | 0.90 | 10 |

Kappa is reported as measured, never asserted as a target. A
kappa of 0 with high exact agreement means one rater was
constant (kappa cannot credit agreement it attributes to
chance); the fix is a seed set with more score variance, not a
different formula. Expert labels supersede this seed set.

## Reproduce it

```bash
make benchmark
```

Prerequisites: a selected PostgreSQL backend with pgvector, uv, and Google
credentials in `.env` (`SCI_RAG_GOOGLE_API_KEY` or
`SCI_RAG_GCP_PROJECT`; see `.env.example`). The backend must point to a
named, disposable PostgreSQL database. The target ingests the tracked
demo corpus into otherwise pristine graph state before strict replay.
Do not clear an unrelated development corpus to satisfy that preflight; select
a disposable database instead. It then creates communities, snapshots the
corpus, runs the full retrieval ablation plus the judged answers eval, and
re-renders this page from the report JSONs. Without credentials the eval
commands stop with a clear message; nothing on this page is reachable
offline, by design: published numbers come from real models or not at all.
