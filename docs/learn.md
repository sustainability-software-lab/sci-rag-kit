# How it works

Sci RAG Kit turns source documents into evidence passages, searches those passages in several
ways, and asks a model to answer from numbered sources. Following one fact through that path shows
where the kit preserves context, enforces rights, and measures the result.

## The idea

A language model can answer from what it learned during training, but that is not evidence from your
corpus. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) finds relevant passages first. The answer model sees
those numbered passages and must cite them. If the retrieved sources do not contain an answer, the
kit says so.

For example, a question may ask how much straw a county produces while the source reports
harvested acres and a straw-to-grain ratio. The retrieval pipeline has to connect those different
wordings without losing the numbers or the section that explains them.

## What happens to a document

1. **Parse.** A PDF, HTML page, Markdown file, or text file becomes headings, paragraphs, and
   tables. Tables stay intact so a row keeps its columns and labels.
2. **Chunk.** The parser groups prose into pieces near the configured 800-token target. Each chunk
   keeps its document title and section path, and adjacent prose overlaps at the boundary.
3. **Embed.** An embedding represents each chunk as a vector. Similar meanings can then match even
   when the question and source use different words.
4. **Store.** Postgres holds the chunks, vectors, full-text index, document metadata, and license
   class. A document and its chunks commit in one transaction.
5. **Build the graph.** When model credentials are available, the kit extracts the entity and
   relationship types declared in the domain ontology. It retains evidence for each relationship
   and summarizes clusters of related entities. This optional layer can bring evidence from several
   documents into the candidate pool.

## What happens to a question

The enabled retrieval layers look for candidate passages in different ways.

| Layer | Finds passages by | Good at |
|---|---|---|
| Vector | closeness of meaning | questions phrased differently from the documents |
| Keyword | exact words and phrases | identifiers, chemical names, units |
| Graph | walking from the concepts in the question to passages that mention related concepts | answers that span documents |
| Community | matching against the cluster summaries | big-picture questions no single passage covers |
| Hypothetical answer | generating a search probe and finding passages near it | bridging question wording and document wording |

The hypothetical passage is a search probe, never evidence. The kit does not show or cite it.

Each layer returns a ranked list. Weighted reciprocal rank fusion combines positions because a
cosine distance, a full-text rank, and a graph hop count are not comparable scores. Agreement across
layers can move a passage higher in the final list.

The `interactive` profile enables vector and keyword retrieval. The `deep` profile can use all five
layers for agents, batch jobs, and evaluation. Layers run concurrently where their dependencies
allow. If one times out or fails, its trace reports the failure and the remaining layers continue.

Rights filters apply inside each retrieval query before ranking and limiting. This prevents an
ineligible passage from occupying a bounded candidate slot and then disappearing after the search.
Community summaries disable themselves for scoped requests because they combine evidence before a
request's scope is known.

The answer model receives the highest-ranked passages with stable numbers. Its response maps each
citation number back to the document and chunk that supplied the evidence.

## How the results are measured

Each domain has seed questions with reference evidence. Retrieval evaluation measures whether that
evidence appears and compares layer configurations on the same corpus. Answer evaluation uses two
separate model passes: grounding and citation accuracy are judged against retrieved sources, while
correctness is judged against the reference answer.

Reports record the corpus fingerprint, model identities, and git commit. That provenance identifies
what produced a run; it does not make model-backed scores deterministic. Use the [evaluation
workflow](evaluation.md) to compare matched runs and the [benchmarks](benchmarks.md) to inspect the
current demo evidence.
